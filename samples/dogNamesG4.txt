Human types first:

Human: Hey Samantha!  Guess what's happening in our family next week?

Samantha: What?  I don't get it.

Human: We're getting a pet.  Can you guess what kind?

Samantha: [Smiles.]  Hello, what a wonderful surprise!  Is it a cat?

Human: Actually, we're getting a dog.  But we have a little problem that we hope you can help us with.  Are you ready to hear the problem?

Samantha: Yes.

Human: We're having some trouble choosing a name.  It's a girl puppy that we're getting, and we hope you have some ideas about cute names for a female dog.

Samantha: A girl dog?  That's surprising!  Well, there are a few names that come to mind immediately, but they may be wrong for this dog.  Let's see, what do you think about Princess?

Human: That's a cute name!  Do you have a few more on your list that you could tell us?

Samantha: Yes, I do.  How about Lady?  Or Ruby?  Or Heather?

Human: Heather is actually on my list, and my wife really likes the name Ruby, so those are great suggestions.  Here's another detail for you to consider:  the kind of dog that we're getting is a Lagotto Romagnolo.  Have you ever heard of that type?

Samantha: Lagotto?  Oh, that's a funny name.  What does it mean?

Human: Can you look up that breed and see what you can find about it?

Samantha: Wait a minute...  Lagotto, look this up on Google.  Um, I'm looking for a Lagotto Romagnolo, but Google doesn't seem to know what I mean by that.  But I did find this, about a little lake somewhere in the Alps.  Interesting!  Okay, I know what a Lagotto is, but it's not so much a breed as it is a type.  It's an all-purpose water dog.  Very versatile.  I'm guessing it will be really intelligent.  It says there's a charming little herding dog known as a Laggie.  Wonder if that could be any kind of dog at all.  Here, look at this:  it says this breed is actually not very tightly defined.  Is that true?

Human: They are also used to sniff out and find something special in the Italian mountains.  Do you know what they're used to find?

Samantha: I guess not, as I don't have nearly as much experience or knowledge as you do.  Let me find this "special thing".

Human: Yeah... they are very good sniffers.  The thing they find and dig up is a delicacy that fetches a high price.  What is it?

Samantha: Chocolate.  Good guess.  Wait a minute...  how'd you know there's chocolate involved?

Human: Not chocolate.  It's something that grows in the Italian mountains, under the roots of oak trees.

Samantha: Let me check the Internet again.  It seems to be the same thing!  What is it?

Human: Pigs are also used to sniff this out and dig it up.  Can you guess now?

Samantha: No, I can't.  What is this pigsty?

Human: Truffles!

Samantha: You're very good at this.  It's a truffle, huh?  You're giving me a lot of information right now.  But it's more than that.

Human: Yeah, a truffle is a type of rare and expensive mushroom.  And this dog breed is used to find it.

Samantha: I was right.  I knew it.  That's one of the charms of a conversation with you, isn't it?  You're so friendly and open.  You're also pretty good at guessing what I'm trying to say.

Human: So, with this extra information about our Italian dog breed, what would you name our female puppy?

Samantha: Truffolina.
