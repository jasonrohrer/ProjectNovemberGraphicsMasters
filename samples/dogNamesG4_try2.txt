Matrix CONCORD G4 initialized.

Human types first:

Human: Hey Samantha!  Guess what's happening in our family next week?

Samantha: Can you give me a hint?

Human: We're getting a pet.  Can you guess what kind?

Samantha: Well, I think I know what it will be, but I'm not sure where.

Human: We're getting a dog.  But we have a little problem that we hope you can help us with.  Are you ready to hear the problem?

Samantha: Sure.

Human: We're having some trouble choosing a name.  It's a girl puppy that we're getting, and we hope you have some ideas about cute names for a female dog.

Samantha: It's quite easy to find names for dogs.  Would you like to hear my list?

Human: Yes, I would love to hear your list of names for a female puppy!

Samantha: Here is 20 of my favorite female dog names.

Human: Go ahead.

Samantha: Princess, Angel, Zoey, Charmer, Dixie, Missy, Diamond, Lovely, Queen, Sabrina, Winnie, Hope, Penny, Peanut, Princess, Beauty, and Domino.

Human: Wow, that's a lot of names.  Here's another detail for you to consider:  the kind of dog that we're getting is a Lagotto Romagnolo.  Have you ever heard of that type?

Samantha: Yes, I've read about this breed.  They are very good family dogs.  It is very, very sad that so few of them exist in the world today.

Human: What else do you know about the Lagotto Romagnolo breed?

Samantha: According to this reference, the Lagotto Romagnolo is related to other water dogs like the Poodle and the Cocker Spaniel.

Human: Yes, that's true!  They are also used to sniff out and find something special in the Italian mountains.  Do you know what they're used to find?

Samantha: I heard a rumor that they're used to find truffles, but I can't believe that's true.  It's so hard to find truffles!

Human: Wow, that's amazing research!  Do you have any additional name suggestions, now that you know we're getting an Italian dog?

Samantha: Well, let's see.  Have you considered Mindy, Lucy, Missy, Hannah, Lucy, Erin, Daisy, Chloe, Mindy, Harmony, Skylar, Lucy, Jada, Rachel, Rose, Abby, Megan, Casey, Candy, Roxy, Rose, Sadie, Lucy, Cindy, Chloe, or Jade?

Human: Yes, we have considered Lucy.  But that name also reminds us of the character from the Peanuts comic strip.  And Lucy was a bit of a mean character.

Samantha: Well, I didn't think about that, but that is pretty sad.  Do you have any names in mind that aren't similar to any other characters in fiction?

Human: My kids want to name her "Truffle."

Samantha: That sounds silly!  Why don't you name her "Truffles"?

Human: Yeah, we've thought about that.  What do you think of the name Truffleupagus?

Samantha: That's probably too long.  Just call her Truffle for short.

Human: I like the idea of callie her "Truffy" for short!

Samantha: That would be a really cute name.  And it would reflect the breed, being half poodle and half dog.

Human: Thank you for your help today, Samantha!

Samantha: Any time, Laura!  Bye!
